      This job was added in Newton when placement and cellsv2
      were optional. Placement and cellsv2 are required starting in Ocata. In
      Pike, the service user token functionality was added. This job is also
      unique in that it runs the post_test_hook from the nova repo, which runs
      post-test scripts to ensure those scripts are still working,
      e.g. archive_deleted_rows. In Queens, this job started testing the
      TLS console proxy code in the libvirt driver.
      Starting in Stein, the job was changed to run with python 3 and enabled
      volume multi-attach testing.
      Starting in Train, the job enabled counting quota usage from placement.
      Runs all tempest compute API and most scenario tests concurrently.
